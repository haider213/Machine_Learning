* **Learning** is the process of improving a model's performance on a task.
* A Neural Network tries to mimic the human brain. It is a collection of neurons that are arranged in layers. Each neuron multiples its input with a number called its weight and adds a number to it called its **bias**
The following is a diagram of a simple neural network with 2 inputs, 1 output and 1 hidden layer with 2 neurons.
